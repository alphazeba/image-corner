# WIP:
this was forked from Nestak2's image-sorter2 project.

My goal in this fork is design a system for labeling corners of sudoku puzzle images.

# image-corner
allows simple click to place location features in the 4 quadrants of an image.  
Purpose driven for identifying the corners of a square inside the image.
