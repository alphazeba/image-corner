# WIP:
this was forked from Nestak2's image-sorter2 project.

My goal in this fork is design a system for labeling corners of sudoku puzzle images.

# image-corner
allows simple click to place location features in the 4 quadrants of an image.  
Purpose driven for identifying the corners of a square inside the image.

<img width="700" alt="pic_github_readme" src="https://github.com/alphazeba/image-corner/blob/master/demoImage.png?raw=true">


# how to use
clicking on the image will immediately update the feature in that quadrant.  press "next image" or the d key to move to the next image.  Press "prev image" or the a key to move to the previous image.  Click "save" to write the current metadata to disk.
